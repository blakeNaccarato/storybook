# storybook
There is only one rule, keep the mage alive. A series of adventures have been created and split up into chapters. Your goal is to write a python script that
puts the mage through the trials and returns her/his health, mana, and stamina. 

Mechanics:
1. If the Mage's health ever reaches 0, he/she does not complete the chapter.
2. If the Mage's stamina ever reaches 0, he/she cannot move but can make other actions. Ie. cast a spell, drink a potion, eat a toad, etc. 
3. If the Mage's mana ever reaches 0, he/she cannot cast any spells that cost mana. 
4. The Mage's health, stamina, and mana are reset to their maxes at the beginning of every chapter. 


After initial directory setup, we will try to make contributions through Issue-specific branches and Pull Requests.
